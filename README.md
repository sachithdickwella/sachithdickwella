### Hey there! 👋🧑‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub world! 🚀 I'm Sachith, a software engineer with a passion for open-source tech and development. I'm also diving deep into the realms of AI and Computer Vision through research and development. My playground is microservices development, and I have a blast with Java, Kotlin, Spring (especially the Cloud stack), and messaging tech like RabbitMQ and Kafka. When it comes to the cloud, I'm all in with AWS, Azure, and GCP, depending on the job.

Currently, I'm a student at the University of Liverpool, pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and explore the realm of Robotics. 📚
